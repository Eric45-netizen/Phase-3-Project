- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

## **Evaluation**
### **Model Performance Comparison:**
| Model                 | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| **Random Forest**       | **94.00%**   |
| Decision Tree        | 90.25%   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 88.61%   |
| Logistic Regression  | 85.76%   |
| Naive Bayes         | 85.31%   |

- **Random Forest performed the best (94.00% accuracy)** and was selected as the optimal model for churn prediction.
- **Customer Service Calls and High Charges were key indicators of churn.**

## **Conclusion**
### **Key Findings:**
